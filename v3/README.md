Beeper Desktop is fully customizable. You can use custom CSS to give Beeper Desktop a personalized look. If you build a nice theme, consider submitting a pull request to this repo to share it with other Beeper users!


### How to use themes
1. Click [Themes](https://github.com/beeper/themes/tree/main/themes) -> select the theme you would like to try
2. Select the text content and copy. This code is called CSS.
3. Open Beeper Desktop v3 -> Settings -> Appearance
4. Paste what you copied earlier into the box and hit `Apply`

*Please note:* Custom themes may cause problems visually with Beeper. We have not tested any of the themes on this site. If you encounter issues with a theme, please disable it by deleting the text from Settings -> Appearance and clicking `Apply`.


### How to submit a new theme
