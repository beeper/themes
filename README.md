### Applying Themes: A Simple Guide

Here's how you can enhance your Beeper Desktop with our themes:


1. Navigate to the [Themes](https://github.com/beeper/themes/tree/main/themes) -> select the theme you would like to try 
2. Copy the text content provided with the theme. This is the CSS code that you'll use to apply the theme.
3. Open Beeper Desktop and go to Settings -> Appearance.
4. Paste the previously copied CSS code into the `Custom CSS` box and hit the `Apply` button.

*Disclaimer:* Please be aware that custom themes might occasionally cause visual discrepancies within Beeper. While we encourage theme usage, these themes are not officially tested or endorsed.
